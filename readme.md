Anchors Away! for Chrome
========================

## Intro
This readme alone cannot do justice to describing [Anchoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring). So see the link. However, this extension is designed to help us all overcome it.

You know those bogus "list prices" and "savings" that both physical and online stores put on items? Those are anchors; they set the stage for how you think about the item's actual price. Even though we all know they're fake, that the item never sold at list price, and that we're saving at best a fraction of the listed amount, this information affects us. Whether we like it or not, there it is, and it will affect our decisions. So, what can we do about it?

## What is it?
Maybe you can't go around your favorite mall with a black marker and cross out all the fake list prices, but you get to choose what the internet shows you. The long term goal of Anchors Away is to change the way prices are displayed to us on as many websites as possible to encourage good decision making. Let's be honest, we don't need so much junk and would probably be better off buying less (and probably getting higher quality more durable versions of what we do buy). Right now we're far from that goal, but hey, here's a start.

## What does it do?
Right now, one thing:

* Remove all (hopefully) references to list prices and savings on Amazon

## Future goals
* Allow for filtering on multiple websites.
* Dynamic list of page elements to modify.
* Implement price rounding, where prices are displayed rounded to the next highest dollar to deal with that pesky 99 cent bias.
* Customizable interface that allows showing and hiding anchors.
* Integration with price tracking to show meaningful anchors.
